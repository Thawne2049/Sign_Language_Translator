# Sign_Language_Translator 
Hi, This is Sayyed Ali, to run the code program enter the test_emotion folder.. Run the code and wait for it to intialize...
once the camera records input, gesture the sign and press 'c' key on your keyboard to capture the gesture and frame it into word or sentence.
Thankyou....
